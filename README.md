1. A GUI is designed using PyQt5 module for the CFD numerical simulation of a Navier-Stokes-based channel flow problem. 

2. Tabs are used to create an easy switch among introduction, code displays and simulation app.
 
3. Simulation app can be updated by first typing in the variables and then clicking plot button. 

4. Both contour (contourf) and colorbar will be updated based on the re-calculated horizontal velocity field. 

5. The app tag including contour plot, label, input and plot button are well arranged using QGridLayout.
